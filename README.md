# CWB - Coders Without Borders - Building a multi-platform app with React Native

This repository contains the instructions to develop a simple app using **React Native** and test it using an emulator through Android Studio. This repository was created to guide students from the program CWB - Coders Without Borders, or [Borders: none](https://www.linkedin.com/company/borders-none/), to get started into mobile apps development.

The description and step-by-step for this development can be found in [changes-calculator-app](./changes-calculator-app/README.md).
